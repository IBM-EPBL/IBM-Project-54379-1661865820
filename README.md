# PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
  The project deals on building an application which helps the specially challenged people to communicate between them and the common people. Communication between a       person with hearing/speech impairment and a normal person has always been a challenging task. This application tries to reduce the barrier of communication by           developing an assistive application for specially challenged people.

## Ideation Phase
 Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and
 a wealth of other ideation techniques.
1.Literature Survey
2.Problem Statement
3.Empathy Map

# Design Phase
  In the design phase, one or more designs are developed, with which the project result can apparently be achieved. Depending on the subject of the project, the         products of the design phase can include dioramas, sketches etc

## Design Phase 01
  1.Proposed Solution
